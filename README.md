# GPTs
https://chittle.codes/gpt

An aggregation of the GPTs I find useful, in static site format. 
For now is just a generic static site. I might experiment with different formats (ex. markdown files with hugo or jekyll)

Idea is to serve everything statically and have users upload their own files as pull requests.
